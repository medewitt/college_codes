school\_codes
=============

The goal of school\_codes is to pull the college board codes (CEEB) and school names from the Collge Board's School Reporting bulletin. These codes are the codes used by the college board for schools [here](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/sat-score-reporting-code-list.pdf).

All of the work has already been done, just download the CSV file.

I have spot checked and everything looks good. There could be some weird errors (like pulling in a title from the document into a school name) but all in all it gets everything.

There are no guarantees!
